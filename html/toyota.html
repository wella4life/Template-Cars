              The Toyota Corolla Rumion, also called the Toyota Rukus in
              Australia, and the Scion xB in the US and Canada, is a compact
              5-door hatchback produced by Toyota from 2007 to 2015. Based on
              the E150 series Corolla, the design of the car had been adapted
              from the xB to meet the Japanese preferences. It is also the first
              Japanese domestic market Corolla model to exceed the Japanese
              compact car's 1,695 mm (66.7 in) width limit, by having 1,760 mm
              (69.3 in).

              automaker Toyota Motor Corporation. Introduced in 1966, the
              Corolla was the best-selling car worldwide by 1974 and has been
              one of the best-selling cars in the world since then. In 1997, the
              Corolla became the best-selling nameplate in the world, surpassing
              the Volkswagen Beetle. Toyota reached the milestone of 50 million
              Corollas sold over twelve generations in 2021.

            <p>
              The 2023 Toyota Corolla Hybrid has a budget-friendly price, many
              standard and available features and good fuel economy. While
              practical, this sedan’s overall passenger and cargo space is
              small, and its added horsepower for 2023 still doesn't give it the
              oomph many drivers desire. This Toyota's relaxed ride remains
              comfortable over even the bumpiest of roads, and you won't have to
              stop at the gas pump very often thanks to its respectable gas
              mileage. Additionally, the infotainment system is more responsive
              than the prior interface, and you can now choose between three
              feature-filled trims (versus just one in previous models).

              The 2020 Toyota Yaris offers a lot more than you might expect from
              a budget-priced car. Available in hatchback and sedan body styles,
              this accomplished subcompact boasts the kind of exceptional fuel
              economy that can save you money over the long haul. Its suspension
              is tuned to facilitate driver engagement, and while it isn't the
              quickest at the track, it feels capable in everyday driving. On a
              less positive note, this Toyota offers fewer driver-assistance
              features than some rivals. Still, it all adds up to a value
              proposition that's extremely compelling for shoppers who have
              their sights set on a small car that's economically priced.

              generations. Originally compact in size (narrow-body), the Camry
              has grown since the 1990s to fit the mid-size classification
              (wide-body)—although the two widths co-existed in that decade.
              Since the release of the wide-bodied versions, Camry has been
              extolled by Toyota as the firm's second "world car" after the
              Corolla. As of 2022, the Camry is positioned above the Corolla and
              below the Avalon or Crown in several markets.

              compact crossover SUV, it made its debut in Japan and Europe in
              1994, and in North America in 1995, being launched in January
              1996. The vehicle was designed for consumers wanting a vehicle
              that had most of the benefits of SUVs, such as increased cargo
              room, higher visibility, and the option of full-time four-wheel
              drive, along with the manoeuvrability and fuel economy of a
              compact car. The vehicle's name is an abbreviation of
              "Recreational Active Vehicle with 4-wheel drive",[4] or "Robust
              Accurate Vehicle with 4-wheel drive", although not all models come
              equipped with the four-wheel drive system.
